## How this repo works

This repo is holds materials for the facilitator to run a tutorial around unicodex. 

It's designed to complement the existing [django-demo-app-unicodex documentation](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/django-demo-app-unicodex/tree/master/docs), referencing it where possible, but not repeating it. 

If you're coming to this repo and what a self-guided tutorial, [see the walkthrough](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/django-demo-app-unicodex/tree/master/docs).
